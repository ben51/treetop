treetop
-------
TreeTop is a 'top' like log file monitor.  When a file changes the last line of
text in that file is displayed.  Selecting the file in the tool will display the
last bits of the file providing potentially more information than just the last
line.


Usage
-----
TreeTop requires a list of files to monitor.  This list is contained in a
textfile where each filename (preferably fullpath) is delimited by a newline.
This config file will ignore any data following a '#' comment character.  For
example here is a sample 'config' file:
        # Sample config file: myconfig.config
        /var/log/httpd.log
        /var/log/messages

To run treetop, execute the binary with the config file as the argument, for
example:
        ./treetop myconfig.config


Dependencies
------------
libncurses
libc


Building
--------
Simply run `make' which will produce (hopefully) the `treetop' binary.


Installation
------------
The file can be copied anywhere, spread the magic.
